# Getting Started

This guide explains how to use `console` for logging.

## Installation

Add the gem to your project:

~~~ bash
$ bundle add console
~~~

## Core Concepts

`console` has several core concepts:

- A log message which consists of a set of arguments and options, which includes a timestamp, severity, and other structured data.
- The {ruby Console} module which provides an abstract interface for logging.
- A {ruby Console::Logger} instance which is the main entry point for logging for a specific system and writes data to a given output formatter.
- An output instance such as {ruby Console::XTerm}, {ruby Console::Serialized::Logger} which formats these log messages and writes them to a specific output device.
- An event instance, such as {ruby Console::Event::Progress} or {ruby Console::Event::Spawn} which represents a structured event within a system, which can be formatted in a specific way.

## Basic Logging

Out of the box, {ruby Console}  provides a logger interface that outputs to the current terminal via `stderr`.

~~~ ruby
require 'console'

Console.info("Hello World")
~~~

<pre>
<font color="#00AA00">  0.0s     info:</font> <b>Hello World</b> <font color="#717171">[pid=219113] [2020-08-08 12:21:26 +1200]</font>
</pre>

The method name `info` indicates the severity level of the log message. You can filter out severity levels, and by default, `debug` messages are filtered out. Here are some examples of the different log levels:

~~~ ruby
require 'console'

Console.debug("The input voltage has stabilized.")
Console.info("Making a request to the machine.")
Console.warn("The machine has detected a temperature anomaly.")
Console.error("The machine was unable to complete the request!")
Console.fatal("Depressurisation detected, evacuate the area!")
~~~

From the terminal, you can control the log level using the `CONSOLE_LEVEL` environment variable. To log all messages including `debug`:

~~~ bash
$ CONSOLE_LEVEL=debug ./machine
~~~

Alternatively to restrict log messages to warnings and above:

~~~ bash
$ CONSOLE_LEVEL=warn ./machine
~~~

If otherwise unspecified, Ruby's standard `$DEBUG` and `$VERBOSE` global variables will be checked and adjust the log level appropriately.

## Metadata

You can add any options you like to a log message and they will be included as part of the log output:

~~~ ruby
duration = measure{...}
Console.info("Execution completed!", duration: duration)
~~~

## Subject Logging

The first argument to the log statement becomes the implicit subject of the log message.

~~~ ruby
require 'console'

class Machine
	def initialize(voltage)
		@voltage = voltage.floor
		Console.info(self, "The input voltage has stabilized.")
	end
end

Machine.new(5.5)
~~~

The given subject, in this case `self`, is used on the first line, along with associated metadata, while the message itself appears on subsequent lines:

<pre>
<font color="#00AA00">  0.0s     info:</font> <b>Machine</b> <font color="#717171">[oid=0x3c] [pid=219041] [2020-08-08 12:17:33 +1200]</font>
               | The input voltage has stabilized.
</pre>

If you want to disable log messages which come from this particular class, you can execute your command:

~~~ bash
$ CONSOLE_FATAL=Machine ./machine
~~~

This will prevent any log message which has a subject of class `Machine` from logging messages of a severity less than `fatal`.

## Exception Logging

If your code has an unhandled exception, you may wish to log it. In order to log a full backtrace, you must log the subject followed by the exception.

~~~ ruby
require 'console'

class Cache
	def initialize
		@entries = {}
	end
	
	def fetch(key)
		@entries.fetch(key)
	rescue => error
		Console.warn(self, "Cache fetch failure!", error)
	end
end

Cache.new.fetch(:foo)
~~~

This will produce the following output:

<pre><font color="#C01C28">  0.0s    error:</font> <b>Cache</b> <font color="#8B8A88">[oid=0x848] [ec=0x85c] [pid=571936] [2024-05-03 10:55:11 +1200]</font>
               | Cache fetch failure!
               |   <font color="#C01C28"><b>KeyError</b></font>: <b>key not found: :foo (</b><u style="text-decoration-style:solid"><b>KeyError</b></u><b>)</b>
               |   â†’ <font color="#C01C28">test.rb:15</font> in `fetch&apos;
               |     <font color="#C01C28">test.rb:15</font> in `fetch&apos;
               |     <font color="#C01C28">test.rb:21</font> in `&lt;top (required)&gt;&apos;
</pre>

## Program Structure

Generally, programs should use the global `Console` interface to log messages.

Individual classes should not be catching and logging exceptions. It makes for simpler code if this is handled in a few places near the top of your program. Exceptions should collect enough information such that logging them produces a detailed backtrace leading to the failure.

### Multiple Outputs

Use `Console::Split` to log to multiple destinations.

``` ruby
require "console"
require "console/output/split"

terminal = Console::Output::Terminal.new($stderr)
serialized = Console::Output::Serialized.new(File.open("log.json", "a"))
Console.logger = Console::Logger.new(Console::Output::Split[terminal, serialized])

Console.info "I can go everywhere!"
```

### Custom Log Levels

`Console::Filter` implements support for multiple log levels.

``` ruby
require "console"

MyLogger = Console::Filter[noise: 0, stuff: 1, broken: 2]

# verbose: true - log severity/name/pid etc.
logger = MyLogger.new(Console.logger, name: "Java", verbose: true)

logger.broken("It's so janky.")
```
