Provides beautiful console logging for Ruby applications. Implements fast, buffered log output.

## Motivation

When Ruby decided to reverse the order of exception backtraces, I finally gave up using the built in logging and decided restore sanity to the output of my programs once and for all!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'console'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

## Usage

As your code executes, it generates interesting events which you want to know about. The general approach is to use an `Console::Logger` which outputs text to the terminal. The text is generated by inspecting the console that occurred.

Capturing structured information allows it to be used in different ways. These events can be sent to a logger or some other system (e.g. web browser, syslog) and analysed in more detail.

### Default Logger

Generally speaking, use `Console.logger` which is suitable for logging to the user's terminal.

### Module Integration

```ruby
require 'console'

# Set the log level:
Console.logger.debug!

module MyModule
	extend Console
	
	def self.test_logger
		logger.debug "GOTO LINE 1."
		logger.info "5 things your doctor won't tell you!"
		logger.warn "Something didn't work as expected!"
		logger.error "The matrix has two cats!"
	end
	
	test_logger
end
```

### Class Integration

```ruby
require 'console'

# Set the log level:
Console.logger.debug!

class MyObject
	include Console

	def test_logger
		logger.debug "GOTO LINE 1."
		logger.info "5 things your doctor won't tell you!"
		logger.warn "Something didn't work as expected!"
		logger.error "The matrix has two cats!"
	end
end

MyObject.new.test_logger
```

### Console Formatting

Console classes are used to wrap data which can generate structured log messages:

```ruby
require 'console'

class MyConsole < Console::Generic
	def format(output, terminal, verbose)
		output.puts "My console text!"
	end
end

Console.logger.info("My Console", MyConsole.new)
```

#### Failure Events

`Console::Event::Failure` represents an exception and will log the message and backtrace recursively.

#### Spawn Events

`Console::Event::Spawn` represents the execution of a command, and will log the environment, arguments and options used to execute it.

### Custom Log Levels

`Console::Filter` implements support for multiple log levels.

```ruby
require 'console'

MyLogger = Console::Filter[noise: 0, stuff: 1, broken: 2]

logger = MyLogger.new(Console.logger, name: "Java")
logger.verbose! # log severity/name/pid etc.

logger.broken("It's so janky.")
```

### Multiple Outputs

Use `Console::Split` to log to multiple destinations.

```ruby
require 'console/terminal'
require 'console/serialized/logger'
require 'console/logger'
require 'console/split'

terminal = Console::Terminal::Logger.new
file = Console::Serialized::Logger.new(File.open("log.json", "a"))

logger = Console::Logger.new(Console::Split[terminal, file])

logger.info "I can go everywhere!"
```

### Custom Logger Output

`Console::Logger` provides a default interface which is a drop in replacemnet for `Logger` and other similar implementations. The only method required for output is `#call(*arguments, **options, &block)`.

```ruby
require 'console/logger'

output = proc do |*arguments, **options, &block|
	puts "arguments: #{arguments.inspect} options: #{options.inspect} block: #{block.call}"
end

logger = Console::Logger.new(output)

logger.info("Hello World!", meta: "data") {"block"}
# => arguments: ["Hello World!"] options: {:severity=>:info, :meta=>"data"} block: block
```
