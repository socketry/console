module Console
	# Represents a class resolver that can be used to set log levels for different classes as they become available.
	class Resolver
		# You can change the log level for different classes using CONSOLE_$LEVEL env vars.
		#
		# e.g. `CONSOLE_WARN=Acorn,Banana CONSOLE_DEBUG=Cat` will set the log level for the classes Acorn and Banana to `warn` and Cat to `debug`. This overrides the default log level.
		#
		# You can enable all log levels for a given class by using `CONSOLE_ON=MyClass`. Similarly you can disable all logging using `CONSOLE_OFF=MyClass`.
		#
		# @parameter logger [Logger] A logger instance to set the logging levels on.
		# @parameter env [Hash] The environment to read levels from.
		# @returns [Nil] If there were no custom logging levels specified in the environment.
		# @returns [Resolver] If there were custom logging levels, then the created resolver is returned.

		#
		# If the class is already defined, the block will be called immediately.
