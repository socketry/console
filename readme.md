# Console

Provides beautiful console logging for Ruby applications. Implements fast, buffered log output.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/console/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/console/actions?workflow=Test)

## Motivation

When Ruby decided to reverse the order of exception backtraces, I finally gave up using the built in logging and decided restore sanity to the output of my programs once and for all\!

## Features

  - Thread safe global logger with per-fiber context.
  - Carry along context with nested loggers.
  - Enable/disable log levels per-class.
  - Detailed logging of exceptions.
  - Beautiful logging to the terminal or structured logging using JSON.
